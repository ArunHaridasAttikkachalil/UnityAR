# UnityAR
This is an Android Augmented Reality (AR) app developed using Unity, AR Foundation, and Google ARCore. 
What the Project Does?
This project enables users to place, rotate, reposition, and remove virtual furniture in real-world environments using Augmented Reality (AR). Built using **Unity**, **AR Foundation** and **Google ARCore**, it provides an intuitive UI for interacting with 3D models, simulating interior design changes in real-time through a mobile device.
Why the Project Is Useful?
Interior design decisions often require visualizing how furniture fits into a physical space. This project eliminates guesswork by allowing users to:
  Preview furniture placement in actual room layouts.
  Interact with 3D modelsâ€”move, scale, rotate, and remove objects freely.
  Lets users interact with 3D models of common furniture items like sofas, chairs, tables, and beds.
  Experiment with design choices before making real-world changes or purchases.
This tool is especially useful for designers, homeowners, or retailers who want to offer virtual staging capabilities, improving both efficiency and customer satisfaction.
